1. For some reason whenever I draw 2 sevens, the option to double down doesn't work.  I honestly spent the whole class period on tuesday trying to figure out what was happening, and I couldn't fix the bug
2. Because each of my cards is initialized as 2 ints, it makes it much easier to run calculations based off of the values of the cards and the suits
3. Because you can have complicated proccesses with multiple objects that you completly complete from scratch.
4. A private method/variable can only be referenced by the class that it is in.  A public one can be referenced from any class
5. A class is used for creating objects, an instance is used for controlling the behavior of an objects, it is a method. 
6.  Inheritance is used to import properties and behaivors of one object into the other, it is usefull because you can create complex objects without having to rewrite lots of code. 
7. this refers to the object class that "this" is inside of.  "Super" refers to the parent class, or the class that the class "super" is inside of is inherited from
8. State and Behavior
9. I still am confused by refrencing other objects that aren't inherited from.
